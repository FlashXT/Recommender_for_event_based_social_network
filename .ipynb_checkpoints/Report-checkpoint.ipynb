    "## Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "In the present scenario, a plethora of events are being held daily at different places and different times. Hence, it is difficult for a user to keep track of all the events and choose between various events which to attend. The problem worsens because the users do not know which events would be interesting and relevant to them. Hence, it is important that an event sharing social network use recommenders to suggest relevant and interesting events to its users which help them choose between various events. While recommending events, another problem whiich arises is that of unseen data. We do not know for sure which users will attend what events, especially in the case of new users. This is often called the cold start problem. There are many Event Based Social Network (EBSN) websites like meetup.com, eventbrite.com etc., which could deploy this algorithm in order to successfully suggest interesting and relevant events to its users.\n"

    "## Related Work\n",
    "There has been some work done in hybrid approaches in event recommendation by Minkov et al. [1]. This paper demonstrates collaborative filtering on a dataset of academic events. Our implementation of the recommender system follows [2], which also utilizes other signals such as a group of users, location, and temporal preferences. Khrouf and Troncy [3] for recommending music related events, utilized category information about different artists from a well-known source. But this approach fails when we do not have this information about every event, as events can be across different domains. Our implementation takes into account RSVP and group information and other contextual data. Recent works [4] have shown that pure matrix factorization (based only on user-event interactions) performs poorly on EBSN data in comparison to other methods due to a high level of the sparsity of these datasets. As per experiments carried out, state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms did not perform better than simple collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based k-NN. Thus the focus is on considering the explicit features than the latent ones."

    "## Approach & Methods\n",
    "We first collected the data from the authors and stored them into python dictionaries. We used data from Jan 1, 2010 - Jan 2014. The data contains the following information:\n",
    "1. Events: description of events, group to which event belongs to\n",
    "2. Members: description of member, events the member has rsvp'd\n",
    "3. Groups: events organized by the group, members involved in the group\n",
    "\n",
    "We, then, divided the data into timestamps of 6 months. For example, one timestamp would be July 1, 2010. Then, the first 6 months were used for training and the last 6 months for testing. We extracted the following features to recommend events: time, location, description and group frequency of event. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, that we have built a model of the data, we then computed similarity scores for each member with the events that they had rsvp'd. Events in the first half were used to train the model and the events in the second half were used to test it. Note that we knew the events which the members had rsvp'd for the both the halves. So, the rsvp's for the second half were used to evaluate the model. Here's our index.py file, which is what you need run. "
